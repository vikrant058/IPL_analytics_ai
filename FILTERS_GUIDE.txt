                    IPL ANALYTICS AI - FILTER GUIDE
                  Comprehensive Explanation of All Available Filters
================================================================================

This document explains all filters supported by the IPL Analytics AI chatbot.
Use these filters to get precise, contextualized player and team statistics.

================================================================================
1. MATCH PHASE / OVERS (POWERPLAY, MIDDLE, DEATH)
================================================================================

WHAT IS IT?
  Divides a 20-over T20 match into three distinct phases based on overs played.

CATEGORIES:
  • POWERPLAY (Overs 1-6)
    - First 6 overs of each innings
    - Fielding restrictions apply (max 2 fielders outside 30-yard circle)
    - Aggressive batting expected, bowlers under pressure
    - Example: "Rohit's powerplay statistics"

  • MIDDLE OVERS (Overs 6-15.6)
    - The consolidation phase of the innings
    - Mid-game momentum building
    - Mix of aggressive and careful cricket
    - Example: "Kohli's average in middle overs"

  • DEATH OVERS (Overs 16-20)
    - Final 5 overs of an innings (also called "slog overs")
    - High-risk aggressive batting
    - Bowlers try to restrict runs with yorkers and variations
    - Example: "Bumrah's death bowling economy"

HOW IT AFFECTS PERFORMANCE:
  ✓ Powerplay: High SR required, more dot balls acceptable
  ✓ Middle: Acceleration phase, balance between aggression & survival
  ✓ Death: Maximum SR, high-risk shots, swinging bat mentality

USE CASES:
  "Dhoni in death overs 2015-2020"           → Captain Dhoni's specific strength
  "Compare Jasprit vs Bhuvneshwar in death"  → Head-to-head death bowling
  "Gayle's powerplay performance"            → Opens with aggressive approach


================================================================================
2. BOWLER TYPE (PACE, SPIN, HAND ORIENTATION)
================================================================================

WHAT IS IT?
  Categorizes bowlers based on bowling style and hand orientation.
  Different bowlers provide different challenges to batsmen.

CATEGORIES:

  A. BY STYLE:
    • PACE / FAST BOWLERS
      - Speed: 130+ km/h
      - Uses: Pace, bounce, line/length accuracy
      - Examples: Bumrah, Siraj, Cummins
      - Use query: "Kohli vs pace bowlers"

    • SPIN BOWLERS
      - Medium pace: 80-120 km/h with rotation
      - Uses: Turn, flight, variation
      - Includes: Off-spinners, Leg-spinners
      - Examples: Ashwin, Varun, Bishnoi
      - Use query: "Dhoni vs spinners performance"

  B. BY HAND ORIENTATION:
    • LEFT-ARM BOWLERS
      - Unique angles and movement
      - Challenging for some batsmen (especially right-handers)
      - Examples: Starc, Kumble
      - Use query: "Rohit against left-arm bowlers"

    • RIGHT-ARM BOWLERS (majority of bowlers)
      - Standard approach for most
      - Use query: "Kohli vs right-arm pace"

  C. BY SPECIFIC SPIN TYPE (ADVANCED):
    • OFF-SPINNER
      - Turns away from right-handed batter
      - Examples: Ashwin, Sundar
      - Use query: "Kohli vs off-spinners"

    • LEG-SPINNER
      - Turns towards right-handed batter
      - More unpredictable, higher risk for bowler
      - Examples: Yuzvendra Chahal, Ish Sodhi
      - Use query: "Virat vs leg-spinners" (historically struggles)

HOW IT AFFECTS PERFORMANCE:
  ✓ Some batsmen naturally struggle against spin/pace
  ✓ Left vs Right creates angle advantages
  ✓ Experience level varies with different bowling styles

USE CASES:
  "Kohli average vs leg-spinners"                    → Known weakness
  "Bumrah vs right-arm pace bowlers"                 → Unusual comparison
  "How does Dhoni play left-arm spinners?"           → Role-specific analysis
  "Hardik Pandya performance against off-spinners"   → Specialization analysis


================================================================================
3. MATCH SITUATION (BATTING FIRST vs CHASING)
================================================================================

WHAT IS IT? ⭐ MOST IMPORTANT FOR 2026 IMPLEMENTATION
  Divides matches into two distinct contexts based on which team bats first.
  Affects strategy, pressure, and psychology dramatically.

CATEGORIES:

  A. BATTING FIRST (SETTING THE TOTAL)
    • Team bats first, tries to score maximum runs
    • Uncertainty: Don't know target until 2nd innings
    • Strategy: Aggressive, score quickly, build platform
    • Pressure: Medium-high (need good total)
    • Example: "Rohit's batting first average: 52, Chasing average: 41"

  B. CHASING (PURSUING THE TARGET)
    • Team knows exact target needed to win
    • Total required varies (100 to 200+)
    • Psychological pressure varies greatly

    SUB-TYPES:
    
    1. COMFORTABLE CHASE (RRR < 8 runs/over)
       - Easy target, less risky approach possible
       - Wicket preservation more important
       - Example: "Chasing 140 in 20 overs"
       - SR required: 100-120 acceptable
       - Use: "Kohli in easy chases" or "Comfortable chase performance"

    2. NORMAL CHASE (RRR 8-10 runs/over)
       - Standard T20 pace needed
       - Balanced approach: Aggression + Safety
       - Example: "Chasing 160 in 20 overs"
       - SR required: 130-150 needed
       - Use: "Ishan Kishan's performance in normal chases"

    3. PRESSURE CHASE (RRR > 10 runs/over)
       - High-risk, high-reward situation
       - Requires aggressive approach from start
       - Wickets lost early = almost impossible
       - Example: "Chasing 180 in 20 overs"
       - SR required: 160+ needed
       - Use: "Bumrah economy in pressure chase situations"
       
       SUB-SUB-TYPES:
       • SUPER OVER EQUIVALENT (RRR > 15)
         - Cricket's most exciting moments
         - All-or-nothing mentality
         - Example: "Dhoni in super-over situations"

HOW IT AFFECTS PERFORMANCE:
  ✓ Batting First: Less pressure initially, but need strong finish
  ✓ Chasing (Comfortable): More cautious, lower SR acceptable
  ✓ Chasing (Pressure): Aggressive from ball 1, higher SR needed
  ✓ Psychological factors: Chase failures > Batting failures

REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES:

  Query: "Kohli's chasing performance"
  → Returns stats from matches where team batted 2nd
  
  Query: "Bumrah in pressure chases"
  → Shows bowling economy when RRR needed was > 10 runs/over
  
  Query: "Dhoni's comfortable chase batting"
  → Returns stats from chases where RRR < 8 (low pressure)
  
  Query: "Rohit's batting first vs chasing average"
  → Compares his two different batting approaches
  
  Query: "IPL - chasing success rate in 2024"
  → Shows how often teams won while chasing


================================================================================

  "Compare Jaiswal vs RCB and vs MI"          → Performance variance


================================================================================
5. BATTER ROLE / POSITION (OPENING, MIDDLE ORDER, LOWER ORDER)
================================================================================

WHAT IS IT?
  Categorizes batting position (where in the order a batter plays).
  Different positions have different demands and match-up patterns.

CATEGORIES:

  • OPENER (#1, #2 position)
    - Faces first bowls (fresh bowlers, new ball)
    - Aggressive approach expected
    - Building foundation for innings
    - Examples: Rohit, Gill, Ishan
    - Use: "Rohit as opener statistics" or "Gill's opening partnership avg"

  • MIDDLE ORDER (#3, #4, #5 position)
    - Balance between aggression and stability

    - Use: "Kohli's middle-order performance vs opening"

  • LOWER ORDER (#6, #7, #8+ position)
    - Specialist batters or bowler-batters
    - Finishing roles or rescue situations
    - Much higher SR expected (160+)
    - Examples: Hardik, Pollard, Pant
    - Use: "Hardik's lower-order average vs middle-order"

HOW IT AFFECTS PERFORMANCE:
  ✓ Different positions = Different stats and approaches
  ✓ Some players perform better at specific positions
  ✓ Position changes can indicate form or team strategy
  ✓ Lower order needs higher SR to be valuable

USE CASES:
  "Kohli as opener vs his usual #3 position"           → Position analysis

      - Unfamiliar pitch, hostile crowd
      - Travel fatigue factor
      - Use: "Royals away vs home average"
      - Example: "Dhoni in away chases"

HOW IT AFFECTS PERFORMANCE:
  ✓ Home advantage: ~5-10% performance boost typical
  ✓ Away teams often chase more defensively
  ✓ Batsmen's approach differs (pace vs spin)
  ✓ Bowlers' effectiveness varies with conditions

USE CASES:
  "Kohli average vs pace vs spin"                      → Weakness identification
